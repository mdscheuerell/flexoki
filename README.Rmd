# flexoki <img src="dev/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

This is a color palette for R based on Steph Ango's "inky color scheme" [flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki). According to Steph,

> Flexoki is designed for reading and writing on digital screens. It is inspired by analog inks and warm shades of paper... Flexoki is minimalistic and high-contrast. The colors are calibrated for legibility and perceptual balance across devices and when switching between light and dark modes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of flexoki from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mdscheuerell/flexoki")
```

## Color options

flexoki offers the following options for colors:

- an off-white “paper” background (`#FFFCF0`)

- black (`#100F0F`)

* 12-level gray-scale

* 12-levels of saturation for 8 different hues

The following image shows the different hues and levels of saturation available in flexoki.^[Graphic courtesy of [Steph Ango's website](https://stephango.com/flexoki) and available [here](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki/blob/main/_images/flexoki-palette.png).] See [Examples](#examples) below for information on how to use flexoki.

## Examples {#examples}

At present there is only one function in flexoki: `flex()`.

```{r flex_form, eval = FALSE}
flex(col, sat = 400, code = "hex", palette = flexoki)
```

`flex()` is designed to work with scalar or vector inputs and can provide color codes in either hexadecimal (default) or RGB formats. 

```{r example}
library(flexoki)

## two different colors with same saturation levels
flex(c("blue", "red"), 100)

## two different colors with same saturation levels in RGB
flex(c("blue", "red"), 100, code = "rgb")

## gray with different saturation levels
flex("gray", c(100, 200)) # same as flex("base", c(100, 200))

## three colors with specific saturation levels
flex(c("blue", "red", "green"), c(100, 200, 300))
```
