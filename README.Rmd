# flexoki <img src="dev/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

This is a color palette for R based on Steph Ango's "inky color scheme" [flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki). According to Steph,

> Flexoki is designed for reading and writing on digital screens. It is inspired by analog inks and warm shades of paper... Flexoki is minimalistic and high-contrast. The colors are calibrated for legibility and perceptual balance across devices and when switching between light and dark modes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of flexoki from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mdscheuerell/flexoki")
```

## Examples

flexoki is designed to work with scalar or vector inputs and can provide color codes in either hexadecimal (default) or RGB formats.

```{r example}
library(flexoki)

## two different colors with same saturation levels
flex(c("blue", "red"), 100)

## two different colors with same saturation levels in RGB
flex(c("blue", "red"), 100, code = "rgb")

## gray with different saturation levels
flex("gray", c(100, 200))

## three colors with specific saturation levels
flex(c("blue", "red", "green"), c(100, 200, 300))
```

## Color options

flexoki offers the following options for colors:

* an off-white background (ie, "paper")

* black

* 12-level gray-scale

* 12-level scale for 8 different hues
