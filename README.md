# flexoki

This is a color palette for R based on Steph Ango's "inky color scheme" [flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki). According to Steph,

> Flexoki is designed for reading and writing on digital screens. It is inspired by analog inks and warm shades of paper... Flexoki is minimalistic and high-contrast. The colors are calibrated for legibility and perceptual balance across devices and when switching between light and dark modes.
